# Changelog

Newest first. The top section is the release being cut, and it is the **only**
place its notes are written: `release.sh` reads it for the GitHub release body
and for the "what's new" pane Sparkle shows before an update, and refuses to
publish when its version disagrees with `VERSION`.

A section starts at a heading that is `##` followed by a version number, so
headings inside an entry can be anything that is not one of those.

## 0.3.0 (2026-08-06)

### The notes you meant to write

Every recording now has a Notes tab. It is one plain Markdown note that is
yours: open it and type, during the meeting or afterwards. There is no new-note
button and nothing is saved until there is something to save. If Listen asks
whether a detected recording was a meeting and you say no, it asks again before
discarding a note you made during it.

An agent connected over MCP can read that note but can never change it. It can
write a separate Markdown note with the summary, decisions or open questions
you asked for, and file it against one or several meetings. It cannot rename a
speaker, alter a transcript or delete a recording. Agent-written notes can be
edited safely: Listen refuses an edit when the note changed after the agent read
it, rather than silently replacing somebody else's work.

Notes sit beside the recordings in the library, not inside one recording, so a
write-up spanning several calls stays attached to every call it used. Removing a
recording does not remove a note that also concerns other calls.

### Finding a meeting is no longer one long list

The sidebar now switches between Recordings, People and Notes. People groups
meetings by who was there; Notes puts every write-up in one place. Search stays
inside the collection you are looking at. Settings also has a name for your own
track, shown in the app while the stored recording label remains safely `Me`.

### A selection colour that belongs to Listen

Selected recordings, tabs and controls now use Listen's website blue rather
than the generic macOS blue. It is sampled from the app icon and retains dark
text for contrast.

### Still true from 0.1.0 through 0.2.0

About six words an hour are corrupted at chunk seams on a Mac with the memory
for 600 second chunks, and about 33 on a Mac with 12 GB or less, where the
chunks are 120 seconds. Speaker labelling is per sentence rather than per word,
so two people talking over each other inside one sentence come out as one
speaker. Meeting detection is on by default: it starts recording, then asks on
screen, and answering no deletes the audio straight away.

## 0.2.0 (2026-08-06)

One change, and it is a default rather than a feature.

### Listen opens at login on new installations

Meeting detection only runs while Listen is running. The checkbox for opening
it at login has been in Settings since 0.1.0, sitting unchecked, which meant
anybody who did not go looking for it had a recorder that quietly missed every
call and offered no account of why. That is the same silent failure that made
detection itself default to on, so the two defaults now agree.

New installations only. Upgrading from 0.1.0 or 0.1.1 changes nothing on a Mac
that is already set up, so if you want it there, the checkbox is in Settings,
General, under Startup. Turning it off is equally final: the decision is
recorded the first time it is considered, and no later launch overrides what
you chose, here or in System Settings, General, Login Items.

The cost, plainly. Listen keeps a Dock icon and a window rather than living
only in the menu bar, so opening at login means the library window opens with
it. Suppressing that needs a way to tell a login launch from an ordinary one,
and the obvious candidate is not one: `NSApplicationLaunchIsDefaultLaunchKey`
never mentions login items and is also false for window restoration, so
trusting it would trade an unwanted window for the worse failure of opening
Listen and seeing nothing at all.

### Still true from 0.1.0 and 0.1.1

About six words an hour are corrupted at chunk seams on a Mac with the memory
for 600 second chunks, and about 33 on a Mac with 12 GB or less, where the
chunks are 120 seconds. Speaker labelling is per sentence rather than per word,
so two people talking over each other inside one sentence come out as one
speaker. Meeting detection is on by default: it starts recording, then asks on
screen, and answering no deletes the audio straight away.

## 0.1.1 (2026-08-05)

A fix for Macs with less memory, and the first update that arrives with its own
notes attached.

### Transcription now adapts to how much memory the Mac has

It used to work in 600 second chunks on every machine. That figure was measured
on a 128 GB Mac with nothing else running, where the pass peaks at 3.28 GB. On
an 8 GB M1 Air, alongside a browser and the video call the meeting is in, the
same pass can exhaust Metal memory and take the transcript with it. That lands
an hour in, after the recording, where it costs the meeting rather than a retry.

On Macs with 12 GB or less, chunks are now 120 seconds, which is the figure
Speak has shipped on 8 GB machines throughout. The cost is real and worth
saying plainly: one word is corrupted at every chunk seam, so an hour-long
meeting on a smaller Mac now carries about 33 corrupted words instead of about
6. That is worth paying when the alternative is no transcript at all.

Nothing changes on a Mac with the memory to spare.

Because two Macs can now disagree about the same file, `listen transcribe`
reports the chunk length and the seam count on every run. Without it, "my
transcript has more glitches than yours" has nothing behind it to check.

### Updates say what is in them

The update pane was blank in 0.1.0, so the only thing it gave you to decide on
was a version number. It carries these notes from now on.

### Installing with Homebrew takes one more line

Homebrew 6.0 refuses to load a cask from a tap that is not one of its own until
you say so:

```sh
brew trust --cask mugoosse/tap/listen
brew install --cask mugoosse/tap/listen
```

### Still true from 0.1.0

About six words an hour are corrupted at chunk seams on a Mac with the memory
for 600 second chunks, and about 33 on a smaller one. Speaker labelling is per
sentence rather than per word, so two people talking over each other inside one
sentence come out as one speaker. Meeting detection is on by default: it starts
recording, then asks on screen, and answering no deletes the audio straight
away.

## 0.1.0 (2026-08-05)

First release. Listen records a meeting from both sides, transcribes it, and
works out who said what. Everything runs on your Mac and nothing is uploaded.

### Before you start

- Apple silicon, macOS 14 or later. Capturing the other side of a call needs
  macOS 14.2; on 14.0 and 14.1 Listen records your microphone only.
- The speech model is about 2.5 GB. It downloads the first time you transcribe
  something, not during install.
- Two permissions on first launch: microphone, and audio recording. It asks for
  audio recording and **not** screen recording. Calendar access is optional and
  buys one thing, naming a recording after the meeting already in your diary.

### Worth knowing before you record a real meeting

- **Meeting detection is on by default.** Listen starts recording when it sees
  one app using the microphone and the speakers at once, and then asks on
  screen whether you are actually in a meeting. Answering no deletes the audio
  straight away. It over-triggers rather than under-triggers, on the grounds
  that a recorder you have to remember to switch on is switched off for the
  meeting you needed it for.
- **Speaker labelling is per sentence, not per word.** Two people talking over
  each other inside a single sentence come out as one speaker.
- **About six words an hour are corrupted** where the transcriber's chunks
  meet. Known, measured, and being fixed by cutting chunks at silence.
- Nothing asks "keep this recording?" at the end. A recording that exists is
  kept, and Delete in the library is how one goes away, where you can hear it
  first.

### If something goes wrong

`listen transcribe some.wav` needs no permissions at all, which makes it the
quickest way to tell a model problem from a capture problem.
